I implemented and executed an end-to-end test for an NLP application using Flask and Pytest.
The test simulates a real user request, validates model inference, and ensures the API returns correct predictions. The test passed successfully, confirming the system works as a complete pipeline.

NLP End-to-End Testing Example

1. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app
   python app.py

3. Run E2E tests
   pytest test_e2e.py
